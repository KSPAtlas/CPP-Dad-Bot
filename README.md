# C++ Dad Bot
C++ Dad Bot is a recreation of the famous discord "Dad bot" that runs in your command prompt/terminal and is made entirely in C++. 
It is designed to work on Windows/MacOS/Linux (Basically, if you use either cmd.exe or Bash, you're fine.)
It also comes with a precompiled EXE/BIN, for lazy users.
The dad joke command does not work currently.
If you have any issues, make an issue!
